s1p is an intermediate of sphingolipid metabolism, formed from sphingosine through the action of sphingosine kinases (sk). increasing evidence suggests that s1p acts as a tumor-promoting signal, predominantly in the extracellular environment, regulating important cellular properties correlated with tumor potential.

annually the incidence rate of gbm is 5/100.000 of population. according to the national tumor registry 2494 people went down to the malignant neoplasmatic disease of brain classified as c71 (icd-10) in 2020. the evaluation indicates that it is 600 new patients with the diagnosis of gbm. the disease becomes the 9th cause of death among males and the 13th one among females. the peak of incidence appears in the 5th decade of life and concerns the most productive population. routinely the management embraces the planning of the resection surgery based on the preoperative magnetic resonance investigation (mri) with contrast. the common image of the tumor allows to put the preliminary diagnosis with the high probability rate. the gbm occurs as the enhanced tumor with the central necrosis and the circumferential brain edema visible in t2 and flair sequences of mri. commonly the border of tumor becomes the line of contrast enhancement. the enhances area is the aim of surgical treatment. the lack of the preoperative enhanced area in the postoperative mri is assumed as the gross total resection (gtr). it has been proved that the range of the resection translates into the overall survival (os) and the progression free survival (pfs). despite the resection classified as gtr the relapse in the operated area often occurs. it can be explained by the presence of the glioma stem cells in the surrounding neuronal tissue. they are responsible for the early relapse of gbm. notably, it is evident that the mri with contrast becomes the method which does not reveal the proper range of resection with the relevant sensitivity so as to extend pfs and os. the positron emission tomography (pet) is one of the diagnostic methods having been clinically evaluated. pet assesses the metabolic demand of the neoplasm for the biochemical substrates. that methodology is commonly used in case of severity of the solid tumors. the fluorodeoxyglucose (18-fdg) is the most frequently used. however the high metabolism of glucose within the brain, particularly in the grey matter, 18-fdg has the limitation in the process of planning of the tumor resection. the higher specificity and sensitivity are elicited among the markers including aminoacids, praticularly 11-c methionine (11c-met). within the gliomas the higher uptake is observed than in the healthy brain. the range of the contrast enhancement in the mri covers only 58% of the higher 11c-met metabolism. comparing these results with a tumor resection beyond the enhancement area, indicates the necessity of the precise assessment of the proposed method in the routine planning of the glioma resection.

current body of literature lacks in high quality research concerning that issue. the articles regarding the glioma resection beyond the gtr may be found instead. the surgery is limited to the resection of brain area with the incorrect signal in the flair sequence, suspected of the presence of glioma stem cells. the described technique allows to extend pfs by for about 2 months. in that case the resection is based mainly on the flair sequence which does not determine the presence of the neoplasm therein. the fusion of the mri and the met-pet images would allow to plan the resection so as to cover the area of incorrectly increased marker uptake."

this trial will see patients randomly assigned to one of two types of kds; the modified ketogenic diet (mkd) and the medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (mct). both diets follow the same high fat, low carbohydrate principles, with the mct diet requiring the patient to take some of the fat as a supplement drink instead of as food. patients will follow the diet for 12 weeks initially. the trial will look to enroll newly diagnosed gb patients, from the walton centre nhs foundation trust over a 12 month period.

laboratory studies demonstrate that glioma tumour cells are sensitive to a number of different chemotherapies, including carboplatin. when given intravenously however, carboplatin does not reach a sufficient concentration in the tumour to have a beneficial effect. however, studies have shown that carboplatin can be infused directly into the brain at a concentration that is highly toxic to tumour cells, but not to normal brain tissue. using very small tubes implanted around the tumour, the investigators are able to infuse carboplatin reliably and repeatedly into the area where tumours typical recur. in this study, the investigators intend to evaluate the safety of this approach and determine the optimal dose of carboplatin to administer. it is hoped that this study will also provide evidence of improved survival for patients with high-grade glioma."

glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a type of brain tumour. gbm tumours are usually treated with surgery and radiotherapy. unfortunately, this type of brain tumour may continue to grow or come back (recur) despite treatment.

this trial will compare a new drug called transmid with the best standard treatment that is currently available. transmid is a drug that is a combination of a protein called transferrin and a poison called diphtheria toxin.

cancer cells need iron in order to continue to grow. they need more iron than normal cells. transferrin helps cells to take up available iron. so the cancer cells are attached to the transferrin in transmid, and the diphtheria poison kills them. the aim of this treatment is to kill the cancer cells while not affecting the normal brain cells. this treatment for brain tumours may have fewer side effects than other treatments because it targets cancer cells.

the best standard treatment will involve giving chemotherapy. you may have chemotherapy as part of the treatment when you are diagnosed. or it may be kept in reserve to treat your brain tumour if it comes back or continues to grow. your cancer specialist (consultant) will decide which chemotherapy drugs you should have."

avastin is the experimental drug being administered in this research study. avastin binds a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or vegf. vegf is produced by tumors and circulates in the blood. one of vegf's main roles is to support the growth of new blood vessels. during cancer, vegf promotes the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to tumor cells and help them grow. avastin binds to vegf, which then prevents vegf from functioning. in laboratory studies, avastin prevented the growth of several different types of cancer cells grown in animals. avastin was approved by the food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy. avastin has not been approved by the fda for the treatment of gbm and is, therefore, considered experimental. avastin is currently undergoing testing (alone and in combination with another anti-cancer drug, irinotecan) in persons with gbm that have come back after conventional treatment.

nktr-102 is a topoisomerase i inhibitor polymer conjugate that was engineered by attaching irinotecan molecules to a polyethylene glycol (peg) polymer using a biodegradable linker. irinotecan released from nktr-102 following administration is further metabolized to the active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (sn38), that causes dna damage through inhibition of topoisomerase. the goal in designing nktr-102 was to attenuate or eliminate some of the limiting side effects of irinotecan while improving efficacy by modifying the distribution of the agent within the body. the size and structure of nktr-102 results in marked alteration in pharmacokinetic (pk) profile for the sn38 derived from nktr-102 compared to that following irinotecan: the maximal plasma concentration (cmax) is reduced 5- to 10-fold and the half-life (t1/2 ) of sn38 is increased from 2 days to approximately 50 days. this altered profile leads to constant exposure of the tumor to the active drug. in addition, the large nktr-102 molecule does not freely pass out of intact vasculature, which may account for relatively higher concentrations of the compound and the active metabolites in tumor tissues in in vivo models, where the local vasculature may be relatively more permeable. a 145 mg/m2 dose of nktr-102, the dose intended for use in this phase ii clinical trial (and being used in the phase iii clinical program), results in approximately the same plasma exposure to sn38 as a 350 mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, but exposure is protracted, resulting in continuous exposure between dosing cycles and lower cmax. nktr-102 was therefore developed as a new chemotherapeutic agent that may improve the clinical outcomes of patients."

currently, radiotherapy treatment uses margins defined by population studies, without considering the individual characteristics of the patients. although 80% of recurrences occur in peritumoral areas close to the surgical margins, treatment volumes are not customized owing to the lack of techniques that distinguish between edema and infiltrated tumor tissue.

generating a physiological ctv, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. to do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. state-of-the-art mri techniques are now in use at the erasmus mc that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.

an issue with the current treatment for patients with a brain tumor, is the inability to detect tumor progression early. an abnormality is seen on mri scans taken shortly after treatment with radiotherapy in about 30% of patients.

this abnormality may be a sign that radiotherapy treatment has worked well and will disappear on its own after a while. however, an abnormality can also be a sign of active tumor tissue. then it shows that the treatment has not worked well enough. when there is active tumor tissue, this is called 'tumor progression'. when there is an abnormality that disappears on its own after a while, there is no active tumor tissue. this is called 'pseudoprogression'.

currently, there are two options to determine whether tumor progression or pseudoprogression has taken place: do another brain surgery to see if the abnormality contains active tumor tissue or wait and have regular mri scans until it is clear whether the abnormality goes away on its own.

amide proton transfer weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (aptw-cest) imaging is a new mri technique in which investigators can produce images that show the accumulation of protein. aptw-cest has previously been shown to be able to distinguish tumor progression from pseudoprogression earlier than current standard mri scans. however, these previous studies have drawbacks: they were either done with a small group of patients in 1 hospital, or with a 7 tesla mri scanner, a rare type of scanner not standard in hospitals, or done in animal models.

in this research project the investigators now want to prepare aptw-cest for standard patient care for patients with glioblastoma in the netherlands so that in the future aptw-cest can be included as a standard scan during treatment. the investigators are doing this by introducing aptw-cest mri on the clinical mri scanners of four different hospitals. ultimately, the investigators want to use this to create national guidelines for measuring and viewing aptw-cest mri images for early detection of tumor progression."

however, the full potential of the procedure is to date largely unexplored as most previous studies used forward-scattering (electron-based) irradiation techniques, which frequently led to inadequately covered target volumes. with the advent of the spherically irradiation devices such as the intrabeam® system (carl zeiss meditec ag, oberkochen, germany), even complex cavities can be adequately covered with irradiation during iort. however, there is no data on the maximum tolerated dose of iort with low-energy x-rays as generated by this system.

the intrago i/ii study aims to find out which dose of a single shot of radiation, delivered intraoperatively direct after surgery, is tolerable for patients with gbm. a secondary goal of the study is to find out whether the procedure may improve survival rates."

numerous studies demonstrate that the extent of resection of contrast-enhancing gb volume on mri positively correlates with progression-free and overall survival. this is explained by the fact that adjuvant chemoradiation methods and the body's immune responses show efficacy only with small residual tumor volumes. the interval between surgery and adjuvant therapy negatively correlates with survival outcomes, potentially because the mitotic cycle of gb stem cells lasts only 24 hours. from this perspective, intraoperative radiation therapy (iort) may improve treatment results.

attempts to use various iort technologies for malignant brain gliomas span several decades. some studies reported better survival with iort compared to controls, but most involved small patient groups without reliable resection control or dosimetric assessment due to technological limitations.

early iort methods used bulky linear accelerators producing high-energy electron beams. with portable systems, renewed interest emerged first in breast cancer, then neurosurgery. neuroimaging and software now enable precise treatment planning. bensaleh s. et al. evaluated balloon brachytherapy (mammosite®) for early breast cancer in 2009. the device featured a dual-lumen catheter with a balloon inserted into the resection cavity. after contrast inflation and ct planning, 192ir delivered 34 gy in 10 fractions over 5 days to 1 cm depth. while comparable to conventional radiotherapy in 3-5 year survival, the 16% infection rate from prolonged implantation was a major drawback.

a case report described using a similar breast cancer system (contura balloon applicator) for recurrent malignant glioma in a 47-year-old patient. a single 20 gy fraction showed no complications at 6-month follow-up.

the zeiss intrabeam system uses a miniature 50 kv linear accelerator with rigid spherical applicators producing low-energy x-rays for high surface doses with limited penetration. the 2018 intrago phase i/ii trial by giordano et al. evaluated dose escalation (20→40 gy) in 15 newly diagnosed gb patients. no complications (wound healing issues, bleeding, ischemia, or radionecrosis requiring surgery) occurred. median pfs was 17.7 months (95% ci 9.7-25.9) in protocol-compliant patients, with distant progression remaining challenging.

a recent advancement is electronic brachytherapy using the xoft axxent ebx system, combining a 50 kv x-ray source with a silicone balloon applicator conforming to resection cavities. initially successful in breast and gynecologic cancers, its application expanded to neuro-oncology.

in 2016, the european medical center (emc) initiated a pilot study using axxent ebx for recurrent gb post-standard chemoradiation. twenty-nine patients received 20 gy to the balloon surface after maximal safe resection. median os was 28.7 months (range 14-104) from first surgery. in patients with ≤2.5 cm³ residual tumor (n=16), median local pfs was 14.5 months (8-94), with 6- and 12-month pfs rates of 68.9% and 31% respectively. one grade 3 radionecrosis case occurred (ctcae), with no infections or csf leaks.

study rationale:

* demonstrated survival benefits with gross-total resection of contrast-enhancing tumor
* negative survival impact of delayed adjuvant therapy initiation
* promising preliminary results of resection plus electronic brachytherapy in recurrent gb from emc research this is a pilot, prospective, single-center, non-comparative study. patients (n=15) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will undergo intraoperative balloon-based electronic brachytherapy (iobt) using the xoft® axxent® ebx® system immediately following gross total resection of the contrast-enhancing tumor. a single fractional dose of 20 gy will be delivered to the balloon surface.

subsequently, patients will receive standard chemoradiotherapy according to the stupp protocol (2005):

* concurrent phase (initiated 2-4 weeks postoperatively):

  * radiotherapy: conformal external beam radiation therapy (ebrt) to a total dose of 60 gy (2 gy/fraction over 6 weeks).
  * chemotherapy: daily oral temozolomide (75 mg/m²) during ebrt.

however, the investigators have developed a model to predict regions of recurrence based on machine learning and mri radiomic features that have been trained and evaluated in a multi-institutional cohort.

the investigators think there is significant potential in individualized surgical decision-making in glioblastoma management. the idea that some patients are amendable to radical surgery, while others should be treated more conservatively, is not controversial in other fields of oncology. the current concept in all patients with glioblastoma is ""maximum safe resection of the contrast enhancing tumor"", but this may in selected cases be extended to simply ""maximum safe resection"" tailored to the patient and extent of disease at hand.

densely proliferating tumor cells have been found from at an average of 10 mm beyond the margins of contrast enhancement in high-grade gliomas. there are now several case series, using various definitions of supramarginal resection, but they have in common that they report a benefit of resection with a margin. this potential benefit also comes together with an associated neurological risk, making this approach unethical and simply not feasible in the patients with glioblastoma as a whole.

if doctors mistake the appearance of treatment side-effects for growing cancer, they may think that the treatment is failing and change the patient's treatment too early or put them into a clinical trial. this means that patients may not be given the full treatment and the results from some clinical trials cannot be trusted.

in addition, gbm exhibits a high resistance to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. current strategies for the treatment of gbm are only palliative, and include surgical resection (which is frequently incomplete due to the proximity of the tumour to vital brain structures) and focal radiotherapy. a large number of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. alkylating agents such as tmz and nitrosoureas such as carmustine) have also been tested, but they display limited efficacy.

however, unfortunately, the measurement of blood flow using dce-mri is often inaccurate. mri scanners may use different hardware and software thus the measurement may be different across scanners. the measurement may also be different over time due to hardware instability. therefore, the investigators propose to use an artificial tissue, named ""phantom"", together with a patient. the phantom has a constant blood flow thus it can serve as a standard. errors, if it occurs, will affect the images of both the patient and the phantom. therefore, the investigators will be able to correct the errors in the patient image using the phantom image. uab radiological research team invented a new device for this purpose named point-of-care portable perfusion phantom, or shortly p4. the team recently demonstrated the utility of the p4 phantom for accurate measurement of blood flow in pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. in this study, they will test whether the p4 phantom will improve the measurement accuracy in brain cancer."

the body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. no single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. this research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and t cells. antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. t cells, also called t lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. both antibodies and t cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

the antibody used in this study is called anti-her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). this antibody sticks to gbm cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called her2. up to 80% of gbms are positive for her2. her2 antibodies have been used to treat people with her2-positive cancers. for this study, the her2 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to t cells. when an antibody is joined to a t cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. these chimeric receptor-t cells seem to be able to kill tumors like gbm, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited. therefore, developing ways to prolong the life of these t cells should help them fight cancer.

we found that t cells work better if we also attach a protein called cd28 to the her2 chimeric receptor (her2-car). in this study we placed this her2-car into t cells that were pre-selected for their ability to recognize cytomegalovirus (cmv). this virus exists in most people. these cmv-specific cytotoxic t cells (cmv-t cells) will be more active since they will react to the virus as well as to tumor cells. these her2-cd28 cmv-t cells are an investigational product not approved by the food and drug administration.

• to compare overall survival of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy in elderly and frail patients with newly diagnosed gbm.

secondary objective:

* to evaluate progression-free survival following treatment in both arms.
* to evaluate adverse events according to ctcae criteria in both arms.
* to evaluate health-related quality-of-life as assessed by moca and eortc qlq-c30/qlq-bn20 questionnaires in both arms.
* to evaluate cost-effectiveness of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy

methods:

patients will be randomized to two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. standard arm: tmz with concurrent rt (combined modality arm) patients will receive 15 days of tmz daily with concurrent rt. tmz will be delivered at a dose of 75 mg/m2, given daily with rt. tmz will be administered 1 hour before each session of rt.

after a 4-week break, patients will receive six cycles of adjuvant tmz according to the standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5) every 28 days, up to 6 cycles as tolerated by the patient. the dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 beginning with the second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events, intractable nausea or fatigue.

investigational arm: biomarker based treatment mgmt (+): tmz monotherapy patients will receive tmz at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 15 days on weekdays (monday through friday). this will be followed by six cycles of tmz according to the standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5) every 28 days. the dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 beginning with the second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events. dose will be determined using the body surface area (bsa) calculation.

mgmt methylation (-): no tmz will be given. participants will receive radiation treatment with 40gy / 15 fractions over a period of 21 days (3 weeks).

upon treatment completion, participants will be followed by every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for years 3-5. response and progression will be evaluated using the new international criteria proposed by the response assessment in neuro-oncology working group (rano)."

gbm, like many other cancers, show a sub-population of aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) overexpressing tscs. more specifically, aldh1a1, a cytoplasmatic isoform of aldh, proved to be a novel stem cell marker in human gbm. in addition, aldh1a1 has been shown to be a mediator for resistance of gbm to temozolomide (tmz) and a reliable predictor of clinical outcome; prognosis of patients with a high level of aldh1a1 expression was poor compared with that of patients with low levels. consequently, aldh1a1 may serve as a potential target to improve treatment of human gbm through inhibition of the enzyme.

disulfiram (dsf) has been used for more than sixty years in the treatment of chronic alcoholism because of the unpleasant symptoms it provokes after ethanol intake. the underlying mechanism is believed to be the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood, due to inhibition of the liver aldhs. actually, dsf is a strong inhibitor of aldh1a1 and relatively non-toxic at therapeutic (for chronic alcoholism) doses that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. in addition, dsf has been shown to be cytotoxic on gbm stem-like cells, inhibiting the growth of tmz resistant gbm cells and blocking self-renewal by \~100% , while it has been identified as an inhibitor of human gbm stem cells in high-throughput chemical screens. interestingly, a number of these actions were copper-dependent.

in the current phase ii clinical trial, dsf/copper combination will be tested as an adjunctive and concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed gbm. according to our hypothesis, initiation of dsf chemotherapy after the resection of the tumor and before the introduction of the standard radio-chemotherapy will inhibit aldh1a1 of gbm tscs making them more susceptible to radio-chemotherapy and possibly reducing the recurrence rate of gbm. on the other hand, the addition of copper will probably enhance the cytotoxic effects of dsf possibly through augmentation of its pro-apoptotic and proteasomal inhibitory actions."
NCT02062372,Spatial Analysis and Validation of Glioblastoma on 7 T MRI,TERMINATED,glioblastoma,DEVICE: 7 T MRI|PROCEDURE: Biopsy,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","Maastricht Radiation Oncology (MAASTRO clinic), Maastricht, Limburg, 6229ET, Netherlands","currently, patients with a glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) are treated with a combination of different therapeutic modalities including resection, concurrent chemo- and radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide. however, survival is still poor and most of these tumours recur within one to two years within the previously irradiated target volume.

the radiation target volume encompasses both the contrast-enhanced lesion on t1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (mri), plus a 1.5 - 2 cm isotropic margin in order to include microscopic speculated growth. these margins result in a high dose to surrounding healthy appearing brain tissue. moreover, the short progression-free survival indicates a possible geographical miss. there is a clear need for novel imaging techniques in order to better determine the degree of tumour extent at the time of treatment and to minimize the dose to healthy brain tissue.

the development of ultra-high field (uhf) mri at a magnetic field strength of 7 tesla (t) provides an increased ability to detect, quantify and monitor tumour activity and determine post-treatment effects on the normal brain tissue as a result of a higher resolution, greater coverage and shorter scan times compared to 1.5 t and 3 t images. up to now, only few investigators have examined the use of uhf mri in patients with malignant brain tumours. these studies show its potential to assess tumour microvasculature and post-radiation effects such as microhaemorrhages.

this study analyzes the accuracy of the 7t mri in identifying the gross tumour volume (gtv) in patients with an untreated gbm by comparing biopsy results to 7t images. these biopsies will be taken from suspected regions of gbm based on 7t mri that do not appear as such on 3t mri. we hypothesize that with the 7t mri the gtv can be more accurately and extensively identified when compared to the 3t mri."

despite the increase in therapies available, the median survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) remains less than 15 months.

the phase iii pivotal study in newly diagnosed gbm also met its co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (pfs) which further confirm the efficacy of bevacizumab in gbm.

early predicting the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with conventional therapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma could help us to identify the suitable patients to receive suitable treatment in gbm. thus, characterizing the blood flow and blood volume in the tumor and their changes during therapy might provide information on vasculature growth or collapse,edema formation, tumor growth, and/or cell death(necrosis) .we decided to investigate whether the estimation of blood circulation in tumor, using mri,pet could be used as a surrogate marker to predict the early response of gbm to bevacizumab.

several previous studies have demonstrated that the relative cerebral blood volume (rcbv) correlated with the histologic grade of gliomas and investigated the prognostic value of the tumor cbv for survival.in current study, we hypothesized that, the temporal changes during anti-angiogenesis therapy in specific regions of high and low perfusion in glioblastoma might predict the efficacy of bevacizumab.since there is no mature pet tracer directly image vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) in china,we use 18f-galacto-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (rgd)-- a new tracer for pet imaging of αvβ3 by testing standardized uptake value mean (suvmean),standardized uptake value max (suvmax) and tumor to non-tumor tissue ratios (t/nt) to indirectly reflect the vegf expression. the integrin αvβ3 is an important receptor affecting tumor growth, local invasiveness, and metastatic potential. specifically, αvβ3 is highly expressed on activated endothelial cells during angiogenesis.

therefore, in the pilot study, we use dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dce-mri),dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (dsc-mri) and 18f-galacto-rgd pet to explore the potential image biomarkers of bevacizumab used in newly diagnosed glioblastoma."

high grade glioma is an aggressive neoplasm with median survival of 12 months, irrespective of any treatment. the prognosis of these patients can only be decided based on pathology after biopsy or surgery. conventional imaging techniques, such as routine magnetic resonance imaging(mri), do not accurately predict the grade of malignancy of cerebral gliomas. computed tomography(ct) perfusion allows us to study the blood supply to the tumor at the level of capillaries. this information permits determination of aggressiveness of cerebral gliomas at the time of diagnosis.

the per-operative fluorescence-guided surgery (fgs) is an innovative alternative technique to support the surgical resection. the 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ala), a molecule absorbed by the patient before surgery is captured specifically by the tumor cells and transformed into a fluorochrome revealed intraoperatively by a light source length adapted wave with a set of lenses included in the microscope. resection is thus guided by this fluorescence whose disappearance translates complete tumor resection.

its interest is twofold:

* increase the percentage of complete tumor resection.
* improve disease-free survival and overall survival. the objective of the study is to compare the fgs to the intraoperative neuronavigation for the resection of glioblastoma, on a medical and economical level through a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial.

biomarkers able to predict response to antiangiogenic agents and particularly to bevacizumab are an unmet medical need. we have showed that a low matrix metallopeptidase 9 (mmp9) or a high matrix metallopeptidase 2 (mmp2) baseline plasma levels were associated with a high response rate and a prolonged progression-free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) in recurrent gb patients treated with bevacizumab but not with cytotoxic chemotherapy. we also observed that mmp9 plasma level decreased during bevacizumab treatment and tend to increase at progression. finally, in a retrospective analysis performed in the avaglio trial (a randomized phase iii trial that tested bevacizumab versus placebo in addition to standard of care in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma), a low plasma level of mmp9 at baseline predicted consistently pfs and os gain associated to bevacizumab.

these results are consistent with the role of mmp9 in vasculogenesis, since mmp9 contribute to the recruitment of circulating endothelial and myeloid precursors, an alternative vascularization process which is in part independent of the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) pathway.

monoclonal antibody (gs) 5745 is specifically directed against mmp9. first in human phase i study has been completed. development is ongoing.

our results strongly support a role for mmp9 in the primary or acquired resistance to bevacizumab. therefore, we hypothesize that the monoclonal antibody gs5745 may overcome resistance to bevacizumab through a specific inhibition of mmp9. while a preclinical program is initiated in our lab, the proposed phase i study is the first step to analyze the tolerance, determine the recommended dose of the combination and explore the impact of gs5745 on mmp9 plasma levels and multimodal imaging in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

determine the safety profile and tolerability of gs5745 given in combination with a fixed dose of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent gb in terms of dose-limiting toxicities.

in this research study, the investigators are evaluating whether or not met-pet scans have value in predicting response to standard chemoradiation therapy in participants with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma. a standard treatment for glioblastoma is treatment with a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the drug temozolomide.

in pet scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. the scanning machine finds the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells. with standard pet scans, the radioactive substance used is fdg. fdg goes to many areas of the normal brain which makes it difficult for use in distinguishing brain tumors from normal tissue.

for the pet scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance called met, instead of the standard substance fdg. met gets absorbed by cancer cells but not by normal brain and therefore may be better than fdg in evaluating brain tumors and therefore may be better than fdg in evaluating brain tumors and their response to treatment.

brief description:

the first line therapy of glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) involves allogeneic haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells (hscs), dendritic vaccine (dv) and cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls).

tcs and tscs are isolated from gbm sample. dendritic cells are isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cultured. tumor sample provides tumor specific antigens to prepare dv. ctls are obtained from peripheral blood after dv administrations. hscs are harvested from closely related donor after granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) administration.

allogeneic hscs are administered intrathecally 5 times every 2 weeks, at day 1, 14, 28, 42, 56. dv is given 3 times every 2 weeks (day 14, 28, 42) subcutaneously in four points. ctls are administered every 2 weeks for 3 months, then 3 times every 1 month intrathecally. six months after the therapy completion, the efficiency is evaluated and the cohort demonstrating efficiency continues the therapy, while cohort demonstrating no efficiency is transferred to active comparator arm.

second line therapy involves dv with recombinant proteins, ctls and autologous hsc with modified proteome. autologous hscs are mobilized by g-csf.

carcinogenesis-free intracellular pathways of signal transduction able to respond to targeted regulation of therapeutic cell systems with specific properties, are detected in tscs using complete transcriptome profiling of gene expression, proteome mapping and profiling of proteins, bioinformation and mathematical analysis and mathematical modeling of protein profiles. to find key oncospecific proteins in tscs and tcs, the targets for tscs regulation are detected, as well as protein ligands able to regulate reproductive and proliferative properties of tscs.

using these data of tcs and tscs proteins, the cell preparations to initiate adoptive immune response are prepared: dv loaded with recombinant proteins analogous to key tumor antigens, ctls and autologous proteome-modified hscs.

autologous proteome-modified hscs, dv and ctls are administered as in the first line therapy."

low sensitivity to radiation of glioblastoma is partly caused by hypoxia. hypoxia in tumours is not predicted by tumour size. detecting and monitoring tissue oxygenation are of great interest to modify therapeutic strategies, including local dose escalation for radiotherapy or select chemotherapeutic agents with better impact in glioblastomas.

pet with appropriate radiotracers, especially \[18f\]-fmiso, enables non-invasive assessment of hypoxia. \[18f\]-fmiso only accumulates in viable hypoxic cells. so, it has been demonstrated that pet using 18f-fmiso is suitable to localize and quantify hypoxia. but there isn't any optimal acquisition protocol or standardized images quantification treatment. thus, the interpretation of \[18f\]-fmiso pet images and the predictive value of \[18f\]-fmiso suv (standardized uptake value) remain unclear explaining the need of methodological approaches."

a new technology, the mr-linac, combines an mri scanner and a linac (radiation delivery machine) into one unit. this allows for ""adaptive"" rt by obtaining an updated mri scan each day just prior to treatment, adapting the rt plan to take into account any changes in the tumor or the patient's anatomy on that given day. this allows for a smaller (5 mm) margin on the visible tumor as its position can be tracked daily. the goal of this study is to use adaptive rt with small margins to demonstrate that the local control of the visible tumor is not compromised compared to the large volumes used with standard non-adaptive rt, while determining whether smaller margins lead to decreased radiation toxicity and therefore improved quality of life by minimizing radiation exposure."

doxorubicin is one of the most effective substances in vitro against cells derived from glioblastoma. however, it has no significant effect in vivo due to poor blood-brain-barrier penetration. in a tumor model, tissue and csf-concentrations of doxorubicin were substantially increased when sterically stabilized liposomes were used resulting in a comparable clinical response using approximately half of the dose of stabilized liposomes compared to conventional doxorubicin. a pegylated formulation (peg-liposomal doxorubicin) even further improved the penetration of the blood-brain barrier. case series and two phase ii-studies in patients with recurrent glioblastoma have shown modestly promising results for peg-dox.

in this study, the investigators treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma with 20 mg/m2 peg-dox on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. to determine the dose limiting toxicity of peg-dox combined with prolonged administration of tmz, the investigators performed a phase i part ahead of the phase ii study. to investigate, by means of a historical control analysis, if the addition of peg-dox to tmz and radiotherapy improves the survival of patients, the investigators chose similar inclusion criteria and identical tmz and radiotherapeutic regimes as in the eortc26981/ncic-ce.3 study."

NCT04838782,Role of Repeat Resection in Recurrent Glioblastoma,WITHDRAWN,recurrent glioblastoma|glioblastoma - category,PROCEDURE: Repeat Surgical Management of Recurrent GBM,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","University of Alberta Division of Neurosurgery, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2B7, Canada","patients with recurrent glioblastoma (gbm) are commonly presented to surgeons, along with the question of whether or not to re-resect the recurrence. there is no level 1 evidence to support a role for repeat surgery in this context, but a multitude of observational research suggests that repeat surgery may improve quality survival. unfortunately, these studies all suffer from selection bias.

the goal of this study is to provide a care trial context to help neurosurgeons manage patients presenting with recurrent gbm, with no additional risks, tests, or interventions than what they would normally encounter in routine care. secondary goals include a test of the hypothesis that repeat resection can improve median overall survival, and that it can increase the number of days of survival outside of a hospital/nursing/palliative care facility."

nivolumab is an antibody (a kind of human protein) that is being tested to see if it will allow the body's immune system to work against glioblastoma tumors. opdivo (nivolumab ) is currently fda approved in the united states for melanoma (a type of skin cancer), non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer (a type of kidney cancer), hodgkin's lymphoma but is not approved in glioblastoma. nivolumab may help your immune system detect and attack cancer cells.

bevacizumab is a drug which works on the blood vessel that supply the tumor and potentially can starve the tumor by cutting off the blood supply to these tumors. bevacizumab is commercially available and fda approved for individuals with recurrent glioblastoma.

this study has two study groups. arm 1 will receive the study drug nivolumab 240mg and bevacizumab 10 mg (standard dose) every 2 weeks and arm 2 will receive the study drug nivolumab 240 mg and bevacizumab 3 mg (low dose) every 2 weeks. a process will be used to assign participants, by chance, to one of the study groups. neither participants nor doctors can choose which group participants are in. this is done by chance because no one knows if one study group is better or worse than the other. 90 total participants are expected to participate in this study (45 participants in each arm).

your total participation in this study from the time you have signed the informed consent to your last visit, including follow-up visits, may be more than three years (depending on what effect the treatment has on your cancer, and how well you tolerate the treatment)."

""investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. it also means that the fda (u.s. food and drug administration) has not approved the personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma.

the purpose of the initial study cohort (cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participants tumor. it is known that glioblastomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor. these mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. it is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the glioblastoma to come back in the future.

three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, \& 1c) were added to the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). each new cohort receives neovax and radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of rt, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of neovax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of rt, re-start 2-4 weeks after completion of neovax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. the rationale for adding these new cohorts is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of neovax when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-pd-1 administration impacts the immunogenicity of neovax.

an additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is mgmt-methylated. cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the mgmt status is methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following completion of radiation therapy. the rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the safety and feasibility of neovax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide."

it is believed that the body's immune (protection) system can attack tumor cells and kill them. immune cells called t-lymphocytes (t-cells) can recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors as a signal to attack and fight the cancer. in most patients with advanced cancer, the immune system does not adequately destroy the tumor because the white blood cells or t-cells are not stimulated enough.

before your t-cells can become active against tumor cells, they require strong stimulation. there are special ""stimulator"" cells in the body called dendritic cells (dcs) that can take up proteins released from cancer cells and present pieces of these proteins to t lymphocytes to create this strong stimulation. dendritic cells taken from your blood will be ""pulsed"" or loaded with genetic material called rna (ribonucleic acid), which stimulates the dc to change the rna into a protein called pp65. this protein is produced by a common virus called cytomegalovirus (cmv) that 70-80% of us have been exposed to in our lifetime. recently, we have found that this virus is present in many malignant brain tumors. brain tumors are very aggressive and, for reasons we do not yet understand, are difficult for the body to attack. the cmv virus is a target in the tumor that, if attacked by your immune systems cells, may prevent your tumor from growing. we have found that we can grow immune cells to very large numbers from the blood of people who have evidence of prior exposure to this virus. you will therefore be tested to determine if you have pre-existing antibodies to this virus in order to participate in this study.

we will use your dcs to activate and grow immune cells from your blood to large numbers in a clinical laboratory. these cmv-specific immune cells, called cmv-alt, will be returned to your body when they have become activated. it is hoped that these cells will seek out and kill tumor cells that express the cmv viral protein and not attack normal cells. the transfer of immune cells that stimulates your immune system is called adoptive immunotherapy. we will evaluate two doses of immune cells in this study (dose 1 and dose 2). depending on when you are enrolled in this study you will receive either dose 1 or 2. the first six patients enrolled on this study will receive dose 1 (the lower dose) and the next six patients will receive dose 2 (the higher dose). we do not know at this time if either dose is more effective or safer to administer which is why we are testing both doses. dose 2 will be a larger number of immune cells if the treatment is found to be safe in the first six patients treated during this study.

in this study we will also see, in some randomly selected patients, if giving an injection of the dc pulsed with pp65 rna into the skin improves the function of the cmv-alt treatment or not. you will receive three injections under the skin of either some of the same dc that were used to stimulate your immune cells in the clinical laboratory or three injections of saline (salt solution) under the skin starting with the infusion of the cmv-alt. it is unknown if a dc injection will be beneficial to the immune cells or not so the responses will be compared in patients who receive dc versus saline injection with their cmv-alt. after these three injections, blood will be collected to compare the responses between patients that received saline to those that received dc injections."

some frail patients received hypofractionated radiation and concomitant and adjuvant tmz. for some, the radiation dose is not optimal. moreover, recurrences develop mainly in the initial tumor site. these two reasons justify increasing the dose. to limit the movements of these fragile patients, the method consists of increasing the dose without increasing the number of sessions by using the simultaneous integrated boost (sib) which increases the dose in targeted volumes while the rest of the volume receives a minimum dose. a phase i trial showed the possibility of increasing the dose in sib up to 80 gy in a part of the gbm enhanced on mri.

fdopa pet detects certain more aggressive tumor areas, areas likely to recur. integrating them into the sib seems appropriate. a phase ii trial showed the interest of sib guided by fdopa pet in terms of progression-free survival but without impact on os. this study differed from the one the investigators propose, because a dose and conventional fractionation, identical to that of the european organization for research and treatment of cancer/national cancer information center (ncic/eortc) protocol were delivered, the gliomas were unmethylated mgmt, less likely to respond. studies with sib and hypofractionation are often retrospective and for others, hypofractionation was debatable and the dose increase was not based on pet capture but on mri. however, a prospective phase ii study, with sib and hypofractionation, not integrating fdopa pet has demonstrated the relevance of sib.

in this project, the investigators propose to use the integrated boost technique (sib) guided by pet fdopa to increase the radiation dose in gbm, in patients either fragile and partially operated, or only biopsied and for whom the prognosis is the most pejorative."

in order to be able to make this differentiation, a direct post-operative baseline scan is required. with regard to the advanced mri sequences, it is known that it is necessary to produce the post-operative baseline scan within 48 hours. after that timeframe, operation induced changes start to occur, such as granulation tissue. in that case the interpretation of the scan is no longer possible. immediately postoperatively (\<48 hours) 11c-met has never been used before. therefore, it is unknown whether 11c-met provides a good baseline scan directly after surgery. this pilot will investigate the feasibility of this 11c-met baseline scan and comparison the results with the advanced mri sequences."

however, biopsy is an invasive procedure that is associated with risks. having a non-invasive method to distinguish post-treatment inflammation from tumor growth can help improve care for patients with glioma.

for the pet scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance called flt (3'-deoxy-3'-\[f-18\] fluorothymidine), instead of the standard substance fdg (fluorodeoxyglucose). flt gets absorbed by cancer cells but not by areas of inflammation. because of that flt may be better than fdg in differentiating cancer cells from inflammation.

an mri scan will also be done at the same time as each of the 2 flt-pet scans done for this research study. the two mri scans performed will also help give more information about the patient's tumor that is not routinely provided with a routine clinical scan, such as blood flow through the tumor or metabolic activity in the tumor. the information from these special mri scans may provide more information about the blood supply to the tumor and how this changes in response to treatment. in addition, the mri scans along with the flt-pet scans may help how to distinguish inflammation due to radiation therapy from tumor growth."

in the current study, participants are randomly placed in one of two groups: a morning group and an evening group. based on this group placement, participants are instructed to either take their tmz in the morning or in the evening and record the date and time they take their tmz in a pill diary. the primary goal of the study is to understand if taking tmz at a prescribed time of day (morning/evening) is feasible in adults with glioblastoma. this is a pilot trial, and the investigators hypothesize that it will be feasible for glioblastoma patients to take tmz at the prescribed time of day. the secondary goals of this study are to evaluate participant recruitment, safety, health-related quality of life, and changes in condition over time. this pilot study will help investigators plan for a larger, pragmatic randomized clinical trial in the future."

immune checkpoint blockade, specifically those targeting the pd-1/pd-l1 pathways, has shown efficacy in multiple solid and hematologic malignancies. furthermore, as has been demonstrated in metastatic melanoma, combining pd-1/pd-l1 blockade with other immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown improved objective response rates, though there is a significant increase in serious immune-related adverse events. as such, current trials are exploring different doses, administration schedules, and immune checkpoint agents. one alternative approach, however, is to introduce a tumor-directed therapy such as a personalized neoantigen vaccine combined with these immune modulating agents (i.e. immune checkpoint blocking antibodies) to maximize the tumor-specific response but minimize the toxicity associated with increasing non-specific systemic immune activation by generating a potent and focused neoantigen specific immune response.

study design: in this phase i/ii trial, patients will be treated at recurrence; a surgery will be performed for cytoreduction and to obtain tumor sample, followed with a combination of re-irradiation and ia carboplatin chemotherapy. a careful escalation scheme from 1.5gy/fraction up to 3.5gy/fraction will allow the investigators to determine the optimal re-irradiation dose (10 fractions of radiation over 2 weeks). toxicity will be assessed according to the ncic common toxicity criteria. combined with radiation, patients will receive 2 treatments of ia carboplatin, 400 mg/m2, 4 hours prior to the first and the sixth radiation fraction. ia treatments will then be continued on a monthly basis, up to a total of 12 months, or until progression.

outcome measurements: tumor response will be evaluated using the rano criteria by magnetic resonance imaging monthly. the investigators will also acquire a sequence that enables the measurement of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and blood vessel permeability that are all relevant to understand the delivery of therapeutics to the cns. primary outcome will be os and pfs. secondary outcome will be qol, neurocognition, and carboplatin delivery.

bevacizumab is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for use in patients with recurrent glioblastoma . it works by targeting a specific protein called vegf, which plays a role in promoting the growth or spreading of tumor blood vessels. since anti-vegf agents also affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the way other drugs used in combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor.

in pet scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. the scanning machine finds the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells. for the pet scans in this research study, the investigators are using an investigational radioactive substance called fmiso. ""investigational"" means that the role of fmiso-pet scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. fmiso goes to areas with low oxygenation so parts of the tumor that do not have enough oxygen can be seen.

1. is there a prognostic significance of stress in patients with newly diagnosed gbm on treatment tolerance and (progression free) survival?
2. can this stress be modulated by other factors, like stress of patients partners and patients physical activity, a known independent prognostic factor in recurrent glioma patients?
3. how is the longitudinal course of patients and partners stress and physical condition over the disease course and do they influence (progression free) survival?

answers to these questions will help to establish future projects studying non drug interventions in patients and patients partners to help improving clinical and tumor related outcome in patients with newly diagnosed gbm.

the investigators hypothesize that chronic stress, specifically measured as a disruption of the diurnal cortisol rhythmicity, is an independent prognostic factor in patients with gbm. furthermore, physical activity of patients and stress level in patients' partners may impact - as stress-modulating factors- on stress in patients and on their prognosis.

aiming at identifying stress-related prognostic factors as potential targets for novel treatment approaches, we propose, in a first step, a prospective multicenter cohort study: all patients with newly diagnosed gbm and good performance status (kps ≥ 50%) who undergo standard treatment with combined radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (rct) followed by 6 month of cyclic temozolomide, are eligible. in addition, one ""partner"", defined as a close person living in the same home or close daily contact to the patient, will be asked for inclusion."

in more than 95% of cases, tumor recurrence is observed within 2 cm to 3 cm of the resection cavity within 4-7 months after initial treatments. one of the main causes of recurrence is the inability of chemotherapies to enter the brain from the systemic circulation due to the blood-brain barrier (bbb). the bbb is unique to cerebral blood vessels and blocks most drugs from entering the brain in sufficient concentrations.

the sonocloud-9 (sc9) system delivers ultrasound to locally and transiently increase the permeability of the bbb to allow the passage of drugs into the cerebral parenchyma. the sc9 is dimensioned to cover the resection area and surrounding tissues in patients with recurrent gbm. the large sonicated volume covered by the sc9 device allows for broad bbb disruption and should allow for carboplatin chemotherapy to penetrate the surrounding tumor infiltrative area. by enhancing drug concentrations, it is hypothesized that further disease progression will be prevented."
NCT04223999,Improving Tumor Treating Fields Treatment for Brain Cancer Patients With Skullremodeling Surgery (Neurosurgery),RECRUITING,recurrent glioblastoma,PROCEDURE: Skullremodeling surgery|OTHER: Control,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","Nikola Mikic, Aarhus, 8200, Denmark","the aim of this trial is to test a new potential treatment, skullremodeling surgery (sr-surgery) combined with tumor treating fields (ttfields), for patients with first recurrence of malignant brain tumor (first recurrence of glioblastoma). glioblastoma is one of the most malignant cancers.

ttfields is a new treatment for brain cancer (glioblastoma), which is used in additional to surgery (removal of the tumor), chemotherapy and radiation. ttfields work by sending alternating current to the tumor. the current disrupts cell division and thus prevents cancer growths. electrodes are placed on the scalp and the current is delivered via a small portable battery (1kg). treatment duration is 18 hours during the day, where the patient can do normal daily activities. the average life expectancy of a newly diagnosed brain cancer patient (glioblastoma) is increased from 15 months to 21 months by adding ttfields.

sr-surgery is a minor and safe procedure, that involves creating small burrholes in the skull over the tumor location. the burrholes are approximately 15 mm in diameter. the burrholes increase the electric current in the tumor by funneling the electricity trough the path of least resistance, since bone hinders the electricity.

the theory is that combining ttfields with sr-surgery we can increase the effect of ttfields and in return increase overall survival for brain cancer patients.

the investigators have recently finished a phase 1 clinical trial, with 15 trial participants, testing the safety and efficacy of our combined treatment. the investigators concluded that ttfields and sr-surgery combined is safe and showed promising results by increasing overall survival with the trial participants.

therefor we wish to proceed with a phase 2 trial.

method the investigators aim to include 70 patients with first recurrence of glioblastoma (brain cancer). each patient will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. both treatment arms will receive the best current brain tumor treatment. in addition, one arm receives ttf and the other arm ttfields and sr-surgery.

all patients are expected to receive better treatment than current best practice, since ttfields is not standard treatment in denmark.

the primary aim of the trial is to assess the 12-month overall survival in both groups. the theory is that more trial participants will be alive after 12 months in the group that receives both ttf and sr-surgery.

the trial duration is 36 months with an average expected follow-up of 18 months."

additionally, with the advent of novel technology such as the mr-linac, adaptive radiotherapy with this regimen using reduced radiation margins is possible. use of the mr-linac allows for daily mri scans to be done prior to treatment, so plans can be adapted to tumour dynamics and anatomical deformations. in this trial, we will examine the outcomes of increased radiation dose, combined with reduced-margin adaptive radiotherapy in this patient population."

the pilot part of this study is to evaluate the use of \[11c\] temozolomide pet (tmz-pet) scans and mri scans to tell investigators more about how standard treatment with bevacizumab affects the blood vessels in the participant's tumor, and how these changes affect the way the participant's tumor absorbs temozolomide. ""investigational"" means that the role of tmz-pet scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it.

bevacizumab is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for use in people with the participant's type of cancer. it works by blocking signals on a specific protein called vascular endothelial growth hormone (vegf), which plays a role in promoting the growth of spread of tumor blood vessels. bevacizumab is an ""anti-vegf' agent because it is designed to slow the growth of the participant's cancer.

since anti-vegf agents also affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the way other drugs used in combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor. researchers are looking for how bevacizumab affects delivery of chemotherapy, in this case temozolomide.

in pet scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. the scanning machine finds the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells.

for the pet scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance called \[11c\] temozolomide, which is chemically identical to the prescription drug tmz. tmz is fda approved as a chemotherapeutic agent in cancer but \[11c\] temozolomide is an investigational agent.

in this research study, participants will receive standard treatment with bevacizumab and oral temozolomide as well as standard mri scans. in addition, participants will undergo tmz-pet scans before and after treatment with bevacizumab. the first tmz-pet scan will occur 7-13 days after starting treatment with oral temozolomide but before beginning treatment with bevacizumab, day 1 after starting treatment with bevacizumab and 1 month after starting bevacizumab. tmz-pet scans will be given at the same time as a vascular mri, which will evaluate the changes in tumor blood flow, blood volume, and how receptive blood vessels are while also measuring how much tmz is in the brain."

the rationale in using the virus with chemotherapy begins with the lessons learned in many clinical trials in glioblastoma (gbm) about both the great difficulty of treating this disease with monotherapy and the limitations of the therapeutic virus. the best clinical results in recent years have been achieved with combinations of multiple therapeutics efforts, including, maximum resection and chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

there are very strong preclinical data about the synergy of dnx-2401 and tmz proposed in our trial design. the dose-dense schemes of tmz like the one we will use, have been developed with the aim to saturate o6-methylguanine-dna-methyltransferase (mgmt). the published results to date have shown reasonable toxicity albeit with modest efficacy' these schemes are now in phase iii trials. in addition, autophagy triggered by tmz could help viral replication in the tumor cells 11.

in a recent article from the biostatistics literature, simon et al. write that ""the initial clinical trial of many new vaccines will not be a toxicity or dose-ranging trial but rather will involve administration of a fixed dose of vaccine … in most cases the dose selected will be based on preclinical findings or practical considerations. using several dose levels in the initial study to find the minimal active dose or to characterize the dose-activity relationship is generally not realistic"".

consistent with these recommendations, the general philosophy of the phase 1 clinical trial is to facilitate a prompt preliminary evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. the proposed clinical trial will test a fixed dose of vaccine. there is considerable experience with the synthetic long peptide vaccine platform. the synthetic long peptide vaccine platform has an excellent safety profile, and the optimal dose appears to be based on practical considerations (solubility of the peptide). the dose to be tested in the proposed clinical trial is consistent with other similar cancer vaccine trials that have been recently completed or are currently ongoing. the sample size (n=10) will provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine."

glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer in adults. the current best evidence-proven treatment for gbm includes maximum safe tumour resection, brain radiation over a 6-week period given with chemotherapy pills called temozolomide (brand name: temodal or temodar), followed by approximately 6 months / cycles of temozolomide. despite these treatments, the average life expectancy is generally less than 2 years.

researchers are recognizing that the immune system has an important role in directing the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation, and newer therapies such as immunotherapies. some immunotherapies have been quite successful in improving cancer control and survival in other cancers like melanoma (an aggressive skin cancer), but when these drugs were given to patients with gbm, there appeared to only be a small effect. therefore, finding ways to make existing and new treatments work better should be a priority. recent scientific studies have shown that the bacteria that make up our stool, often referred to as the gut microbiome, play a major role in regulating the immune system. for example, researchers were able to make patients with melanoma who previously did not respond to immunotherapy become responsive to the treatment after receiving a stool transplant from responders to immunotherapy. this provides proof of concept that we could modify the body's immune environment to favour cancer killing by changing a person's gut bacteria environment.

the role of the gut bacteria in patients with brain cancer is poorly understood as very few studies have been published about it in this population. we believe that understanding the composition of the gut microbiome and how it relates to the effectiveness and side effects of treatments in gbm patients will be an important first step to understanding how we can modify the gut microbiome to improve outcomes for patients living with gbm."

we recently showed that dichloroacetate (dca, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) was able to depolarize cancer (but not normal) mitochondria and induce apoptosis in cancer but not normal tissues. we believe that altering the metabolism of cancers like glioblastoma (dca switches metabolism from the cytoplasmic glycolysis to the mitochondrial glucose oxidation) we inhibit the resistance to apoptosis that characterizes cancer. because metabolism (i.e. glycolysis) is the end result of many and diverse molecular pathways, the effects of dca might be positive in cancers with diverse molecular backgrounds. dca is also a very small molecule that readily crosses the blood brain barrier. therefore we hypothesize that dca will be an effective and relative non-toxic potential therapy for malignant gliomas.

we are conducting a phase ii trial with 2 parallel arms: a) patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas and b) patients with recurrent gliomas or gliomas that have failed standard therapy (which includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). all patients need to have a histological diagnosis. dca will be given orally and patients will be followed for a minimum of 6 months. the tumor size will be followed by standard mri or ct criteria and glucose uptake (a direct effect of dca on the tumor) will be measured by fdg-pet imaging. several clinical parameters and quality of life will be followed. potential toxicity (particularly peripheral neuropathy) will be closely followed and dose-de-escalation protocols are in place in case of toxicity. in addition, escape protocols for the application of standard therapy (when appropriate) are in place in patients with no evidence of response to dca. in vitro studies will be performed in the tissues obtained at the time of surgery (where appropriate) and correlated prospectively with clinical data.

the investigators designed a multicenter, single-arm, double-blind, phase ii clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ato combined with tmz in egfr-high expressing gbm. after informed consent was signed by the patient or authorized family members, the patients were treated with the current stupp regimen and ato (20mg, qn) orally. the patients were regularly followed up for 52 weeks after treatment. the primary endpoint was progression-free survival (pfs), which was defined as the time from the start of gbm surgery to tumor progression (recurrence) or death. the secondary end point was the rate of tumor control, which was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response, a partial response, or a stable disease that had shrunk or remained stable for a given period of time. safety will be assessed during the study by monitoring of regular mri scans, laboratory tests (liver function, lipid profile, blood routine), electrocardiography, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature), and weight.

metformin is an oral inhibitor of mitochondrial complex i and is a widely used drug in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, safe and well tolerated in association with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

basing on drastic effect, the investigators have observed in vivo (reduction of \>50% of tumor growth) and hypothesize that metformin could be specifically efficient to treat up-front patients affected by oxphos+ gbm, in association with the standard first-line treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide (rt-tmz).

the investigators set up a dedicated molecular analysis including rna assay and expression of oxphos markers for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors (ffpe), which allows to detect oxphos+ gbm at diagnosis.

here a phase ii, open label, non-randomized multicenter trial including five french neurooncology centers (h. foch-suresnes, pitié-salpêtrière-paris, saint louis-paris, lyon, marseille) and one in italy (istituto besta, milan) is proposed.

vredenburgh et al. from the duke university (durham, nc) reported at asco 2006 (fully published in j clin oncol, 2007) a 57 % unexpected response rate using a bevacizumab/irinotecan schedule in patients with relapsed gbm or grade 3 astrocytomas. this unusual high response rate, sometimes with major and sustained responses, was confirmed by a cooperative french study of anocef (guiu et al., 2008). such a major improvement of treatment effectiveness lead anocef, which federates most of the active neuro-oncology teams in france, to propose a neo-adjuvant and adjuvant bevacizumab-based chemotherapy framing a standard temozolomide-based chemoradiation with the aim to improve the prognosis of unresectable gbm.

the bevacizumab/temozolomide combination as neo-adjuvant is presently being evaluated by the duke university. we believe that an ambitious comparison of the bevacizumab/irinotecan-schedule with the ''standard'' temozolomide-based chemoradiation is a fascinating challenge to improve the treatment of this awful disease.

during surgery to remove tumors of other organs of the body, such as the lung, prostate, kidney, or ovary, cells from these tumors are routinely found in the bloodstream. these cells are believed to be the reason for the spread of these tumors. in the case of malignant brain tumors, this process of glioma (tumor) cells shedding into circulation has not yet been investigated.

this study will determine whether glioma cells can be detected in the bloodstream of patients undergoing surgery. if glioma cells are absent, it may mean they are unable to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. if they are present, they presumably can penetrate into blood vessels but they may be recognized and eliminated by the immune system, or they may escape detection yet not be able to take hold in the new microenvironment. the results of the study will add to the knowledge of the biology of these highly malignant tumors.

study participants will be admitted to the hospital for 8 to 10 days. they will undergo a complete physical and neurological exam and blood and urine tests. an electrocardiogram will be performed, and x-rays may be taken. on the morning of surgery, the patient will receive sedation intravenously. a tiny plastic tube called a catheter will be introduced into a vein in the groin through needles. the catheter will be passed through to the jugular bulb, right above the jugular vein, on the same side as the tumor. the patient will then be taken to the operating room for surgery. during surgery, not more than one quarter of a unit of blood will be removed through the catheter. the catheter will be removed before the patient enters the intensive care unit. another mri will be taken after surgery.

the optimal dose of targeted radiation is not known. therefore, increasing doses will be given to treat different patients, starting with the lowest possible dose. the amount of radiation to be given will depend on whether or not your child received prior radiation therapy and where the tumor is located. the groups of patients will first be divided into 2 groups: group a, who are those who received radiation as part of their prior treatment, and group b, who are those who did not receive any radiation treatment. each group will be then divided again into 2 groups depending on the location of the tumor. in each group, if the lowest dose is well-tolerated with only minimal side effects by 3 patients, then the next higher dose will be given to the next 3 patients.

the purposes of this research are:

* to evaluate the potential side effects of a single high dose of x-rays using the photon radiosurgery system (prs) given to a small area of the brain.
* to determine the maximum dose of targeted radiation that can be safely given to brain tumors with the fewest side effects.
* to see how well this treatment works for children with recurrent brain tumors and newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme."

the glioblastoma (gbm) is the most common and aggressive tumour originating from the brain, affecting approximately 600 patients per year in belgium. the treatment consists in surgical resection of the tumour (when feasible), followed by a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. despite multimodal treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy), the life expectancy of patients with gbm remains limited, with an average survival of 12-18 months and only 5% of patients surviving more than 5 years. in addition to limited survival, most patients with gbm experience impaired quality of life, both because of the disease and treatments.

radiotherapy is a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells. in gbm, radiotherapy is targeted at the tumour (or tumour bed if the tumour was resected) with a safety margin around it (the ""clinical target volume"" or ctv) to account for potential microscopic spread of the tumour. the downside of this safety margin is that a substantial amount of brain tissue is irradiated, which can lead to treatment toxicity. reducing the ctv margin would enable to decrease the volume of brain being irradiated and could thereby allow to reduce the side effects of brain irradiation.

epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) amplification or mutation is regularly observed in gbm and is thought to be a major contributor to resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. the most common egfr mutation in gbm (egfrviii) is present in 30-50% of gbm.

previously maastro lab has shown that expression of egfrviii provides gbm cells with a survival advantage when exposed to stress factors such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. these metabolic stress factors activate a lysosomal degradation pathway, known as autophagy. inhibition of autophagy sensitizes cells to hypoxia, reduces the viable hypoxic fraction in tumors with \> 40% and subsequently sensitizes these tumors to irradiation.

chloroquine (cq) is a potent autophagy blocker and is the most widely investigated substance in this context. previously, the effect of cq has been demonstrated in a small randomized controlled trial in gbm treated with radiotherapy and carmustine. although not statistically significantly different, the rate of death over time was approximately half as large in patients receiving cq as in patients receiving placebo. the intracellular effects of cq are dose-dependent. therefore, the authors suggest an increase in daily dose of cq may be necessary. furthermore, the combination of cq with tmz may induce more damage to the neoplastic cells.

in the phase i part of this trial the recommended dose of cq in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide will be tested. in the phase ii part of the trial patients with a histologically confirmed gbm will be randomized between standard treatment consisting of concurrent radiotherapy with temozolomide and adjuvant temozolomide (arm a) and standard treatment plus cq (arm b)."

g-force-1 will be conducted in two parts; in the first part of the study (dose escalation, part a) patients will be entered or assigned sequentially (that is consecutively) to gradually escalating or increasing doses of rrx-001 after patients have been entered on the previous dose until such time as it is no longer tolerated. at each dose level, a separate cohort or small group of at least 3 evaluable patients will be treated. rrx-001 will be administered by intravenous infusion (in other words, by slow injection in the veins) over 30-45 minutes once weekly during radiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by the fda-approved chemotherapy, temozolomide (tmz) alone for up to 6 months or longer.

in the second part of this study (part b), new groups or cohorts of patients will receive rrx-001 at the dose established in part a by intravenous infusion over 30-45 minutes once weekly during radiotherapy for 6 weeks. then, after a 4-6 weeks break, each cohort will receive increasing doses of rrx-001 and temozolomide (in other words, a double dose escalation) to establish an acceptable safety and activity window, in other words, a dose range that is relatively free of toxicity as well as active against the tumor, although the primary purpose of this study is to assess or evaluate safety.

the reason or rationale to ""add on"" rrx-001 to radiotherapy and tmz, which is described in more detail below on this page, is as follows: rrx-001 is a radiosensitizer and a chemosensitizer, which means that experimentally it increases the activity of radiation and chemotherapy in tumors. in addition, in other ongoing clinical trials, patients have experienced minimal toxicity or side effects with rrx-001 alone and also in combination with radiation in the brain; therefore, the hope is that rrx-001 will synergize or combine well with radiotherapy and tmz in gbm without adding toxicity"

one way tumors are able to grow is by forming new blood vessels that supply them with nutrients and oxygen.

sunitinib blocks certain proteins on the surface of tumor and blood vessel cells that are involved with the formation of new blood vessels.

blocking these proteins may prevent the tumor cells or blood vessels from continuing to grow.

objectives:

to determine whether sunitinib can cause tumors to shrink or stabilize in patients with recurrent brain cancer.

eligibility:

patients 18 years of age or older with brain cancer whose disease has worsened after standard treatment with surgery, radiation.

design:

patients take a sunitinib pill once a day in 4-week treatment cycles. treatment may continue as long as the tumor remains stable or decreases in size and the side effects of treatment are tolerated.

routine blood tests are done every 2 weeks during the first 8 weeks of treatment and then every 4 weeks after that.

magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans are done before starting treatment (at baseline) and at the end of every 4-week cycle to monitor tumor growth.

positron emission tomography (pet) scans are done at baseline and at the end of the first cycle.

neurological and physical examinations are done at baseline, at week 2 of treatment and at the end of every treatment cycle.

health-related quality of life is assessed every 4 weeks.

NCT05671016,Brain Imaging to Predict Toxicity in Elderly Patients After Radiotherapy,COMPLETED,"glioblastoma multiforme, adult|radiation toxicity|quality of life",PROCEDURE: MRI scans and questionnaires,OLDER_ADULT,"Scott Harfield, Brighton, Sussex, BN2 5BE, United Kingdom","the investigators' aim with the briter study is to produce a way of predicting who might be more or less likely to suffer side effects from radiotherapy prior to starting treatment for a glioblastoma (gbm), a type of brain tumour.

gbm is the commonest primary malignant brain tumour. treatment options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or best supportive care. the focus should be on maintaining a good quality of life for as long as possible.

radiotherapy to the brain is an effective treatment, however it can produce side effects. the degree of side effects different patients experience can vary widely. it has been thought that if the patient's underlying normal brain is fragile due to an underlying mild dementia or problems associated with high blood pressure or cholesterol then this might make them more vulnerable to radiotherapy.

mri scans can be used to assess whether there are changes in the normal brain. the briter study aims to use mri scans to see whether the investigators can predict those patients who might be more at risk of side effects from radiotherapy. the trial is aimed at patients aged \> 65 who have been newly diagnosed with a gbm and are going to receive radiotherapy. patients who agree to take part in the trial will have had an mri scan as part of their normal diagnosis. participants will undertake some questionnaires before starting their radiotherapy which will aim to assess their quality of life and their mental processes of perception, memory, judgment, and reasoning (called cognitive function). participants may also need an extra mri scan.

participants will repeat these questionnaires 4 and 8 weeks after treatment when they come for their follow up appointments. the investigators will compare them to measurements made on the pre-treatment mri scan.

participation in the study does not change the treatment the patient receives.

the investigators hope that the briter study will enable them to predict the degree of side effects a patient is likely to experience before embarking on radiotherapy treatment. this will enable more informative, individualised discussions surrounding the best treatment path for older patients with a gbm."

patients 18 years of age and older with gmb whose brain tumor does not respond to standard medical treatment and who can undergo surgery for their tumor may be eligible for this study. candidates are screened with a physical examination and neurocognitive examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram (ekg), echocardiogram (ultrasound test of heart function) or muga scan (nuclear medicine test of heart function), magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the head, and computed tomography (ct) of the head. ct uses x-rays and mri uses a magnetic field and radio waves to show brain structure.

participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* mri and blood tests before surgery.
* surgery to remove the brain tumor.
* follow-up mris every 8 weeks after surgery.
* follow-up echocardiograms or muga scans every 8 weeks after surgery.
* gw572016 treatment starting 7-10 days before surgery and continuing until the patient or doctor decides it is in the patient's best interest to stop it or until the tumor worsens. (the drug is stopped temporarily for surgery and a healing period after surgery.)
* blood tests every 2 weeks to evaluate the effects of gw572016 on the body.
* blood test before the first gw572016 treatment and at the time of surgery to assess the effect of the drug on the cells and to determine how much drug is present in the blood at the time of surgery.

participants are followed in clinic at least monthly while taking gw572016. while on treatment they keep a diary documenting their daily treatments. the diary is collected at the monthly follow-up exams. after the treatment ends, patients are contacted periodically by the research staff for the rest of their lives to follow the long-term effects of the study."
NCT06385132,Psychological and Psychiatric prOfile in Glioblastoma and Head and Neck Cancer,RECRUITING,glioblastoma|head and neck cancer,OTHER: Psychological Tests' administration,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS, Roma, 00168, Italy","approximately 30% of cancer patients may experience psychopathological disorders. the most common psychopathological disorders in cancer patients are mood disorders, anxiety, depression, adjustment disorders, and suicidal ideation. among depressive disorders, mixed depression, with the simultaneous presence of symptoms of both depressive and manic polarity, is associated to higher levels of chronicity, functional impairment and suicidality. these disorders can also be worsened by loneliness and demoralization.

patients with head and neck cancer (h\&n-c) and glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) have high psychological and sometimes psychiatric comorbidity probably due to the severity, poor prognosis of these cancers and harsh treatment toxicities.

the most important protective factor for psychopathology is psychological resilience, which is ""the capacity of a person to protect themselves and their mental health when facing life adversities,"" such as a gbm or h\&n-c diagnosis. resilience is influenced by the affective temperament, which refers to basic personality traits related to behavioral and emotional reactivity to environmental stimuli. it is believed to be biologically determined and relatively stable throughout life.

to date, the literature does not clarify the role of resilience and temperament in mediating the psychological profile of cancer patients. furthermore, extensive profiling of the psychological and psychiatric profile of these patients at such a critical and pivotal moment in their journey is currently lacking in the literature.

aim of this study is to evaluate global psychological and psychiatric profile of patients affected by gbm and h\&n-c and the eventual fluctuation over time during rt course. conducting an early and accurate screening for potential psychopathological issues will give the opportunity to avoid factors that could: worsen patient compliance, lead to suicidal risk, and increase hospitalizations.

the results obtained will be utilized for planning precocious psychological or psychiatric take-in-charge aimed at promoting psychological well-being of h\&n-c and gbm patients."

patients are randomized intraoperatively in a 1:1 ratio following histopathological confirmation via intraoperative frozen section procedure. the trial's primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of atl in overall survival (os), while confirming non-inferiority in health-related quality of life (qol), measured by the global health status scale of the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer (eortc) - quality of life questionnaire core 30 (qlq-c30). secondary outcomes include progression-free survival (pfs), seizure control, neurocognitive functioning, and longitudinal assessments of selected eortc qlq-c30 and bn20 domains. a total of 178 patients will be enrolled over three years, with a minimum follow-up of three years. an interim safety analysis after inclusion of 57 patients will assess functional outcome differences using the modified rankin scale (mrs) at 6 months postoperatively. the study is powered (\>80%) to detect a survival benefit assuming a median os increase from 17 to 27.5 months. if proven superior to gtr, atl could emerge as the preferred surgical strategy for isolated temporal lobe glioblastoma, offering robust evidence in favor of extending supramarginal resection principles to the broader context of glioblastoma care."

* children with brain tumors often have magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans to see if the tumor has responded to therapy or to see if the tumor has grown. sometimes, it is difficult to tell if the scan is abnormal because of tumor size or shape, swelling, scar tissue, or dead tissue. because brain tumor biopsies require surgery, researchers are looking for more noninvasive ways of evaluating brain tumors.
* positron emission tomography (pet) scans use a radioactive sugar known as 18f-fdg to try to determine if a tumor is active or not. active tumors generally take up more sugar than the surrounding tissue, but because normal brain tissue uses the same sugar as brain tumors, it is then difficult to tell if tumor tissue is taking up sugar or not. a different radioactive agent, 18f-flt, is now being studied in some adults with different kinds of tumors. researchers are interested in determining whether it is possible to use this agent as a marker of tumor activity in children.

objectives:

* to determine the safety and effectiveness of 18f-flt for pediatric glioma scans.
* to compare the results of 18f-flt studies with studies using the radioactive agents 18f-fdg and 1h-mrsi.

eligibility:

\- children less than 18 years of age who are having radiation therapy to treat malignant gliomas.

design:

* participants will have scanning tests before radiation therapy, 1 to 3 weeks after radiation therapy, and if researchers suspect that the tumor is growing.
* this study will involve three separate imaging tests (1h-mrsi, 18f-fdg pet, and 18f-flt pet).
* proton spectroscopy (1h-mrsi) is a procedure that is similar to mri and is performed in the same scanner as an mri. because this scan is long (2-3 hours), most children will receive medications from an anesthesiologist so that they can sleep through the procedure.
* within 2 weeks of the 1h-mrsi scan, participants will have the pet scans with both the standard contrast agent (18f-fdg) and the experimental agent (18f-flt). these scans will last approximately 1 hour each."

indeed, pm errors are an important part of the aging memory complaints. the prevalence of self-reported pm failures is also significant among young adults, compared with self-reported retrospective memory (rm) failures .yet, pm errors are major sources of frustration and embarrassment .

in oncology, recently investigated the self-reported memory complaints in a 80 case-healthy-control study breast patients . subjective memory complaints were assessed using the prospective and retrospective memory questionnaire . results from the paquet et al. study show that all participants (i.e., both patients and matched-controls) reported more pm than rm failures in daily-life (p\<.001). breast cancer patients reported more rm and pm failures than controls. however, this group effect was no longer statistically significant when controlling for depression and fatigue.

these findings are consistent with the view that memory complaints are closely associated with depression and cancer-related fatigue, and more generally with psychopathological variables .as underlined by paquet et al. subjective memory complaints should be investigated because they refer to some aspects of the cancer experience that could potentially be linked to quality of life. thus, it is important to explore psychopathological basis such as depression, anxiety and fatigue while investigating self-reported memory failures in cancer patients.

despites the importance of pm, there have been, to our knowledge, only few studies evaluating pm complaints or pm functioning in patients diagnosed with an intracerebral tumor (such as diffuse low-grade glioma- dlgg- or glioblastome- gb) or extra-cerebral tumor (such as breast cancer - bc). therefore, the investigators thought it would be useful, as a first step, to conduct a study to explore and to manage the pm and rm subjective complaints in cancer patients compared to another chronic disease, such as hiv. in fine, these data will help to identify a new target for psychological management focused on either psychopathological or neuropsychological rehabilitation"

objective: in this project we aim to develop a safe and effective technique for adc/fet guided resection of idh-wildtype glioblastoma and grade iv idh-mutant astrocytoma. the safety concerns neurological deficits and time to start of adjuvant therapy, while the effectiveness is aimed at the extent of resection. our secondary aim is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of apt-cest mri and to assess whether apt-cest mri can serve as an alternative for fet pet for the detection of tumor infiltration.

study design: prospective observational intervention study

study population: 30 patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of an untreated high grade glioma (suspected for glioblastoma (idh wildtype) or grade iv astrocytoma (idh mutant)), who are eligible for a supramarginal surgical resection and adjuvant treatment according two neurosurgeons in consensus and who are in relatively good condition (karnofsky performance score (kps) ≥70).

intervention (if applicable): supramarginal adc/fet-guided resection. to make sure that the standard treatment is always guaranteed, t1c mri abnormalities will be included in the surgical target.

main study parameters/endpoints: the main study endpoint is the optimization of adc/fet-guided resection. volumetric and percentual extent of resection, as measured with mri and pet imaging, combined with surgery-induced morbidity will be used as outcome parameters. the secondary study parameters will be the histopathology-based diagnostic accuracy of apt-cest mri in comparison with fet pet, cognitive performance over time and progression free survival.

nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: participants will undergo pre- and postoperative mri scanning. this is also part of regular clinical care, except there are additional mri sequences including apt cest in the pre-operative and pre-radiotherapy mri. there are no risks associated with mri acquisition after mri safety screening. participants will furthermore undergo a pre- and postoperative fet pet. the risks associated with pet scanning are limited, and the radiation burden will remain below 10 msv (icrp62 category intermediate risk (level iib)). during surgery, biopsies are performed from areas that will be resected, so these biopsies will not introduce any extra risk. a potential benefit is the possibility of the removal of more tumor tissue. a potential risk is the additional removal of healthy brain tissue with the risk of neurological damage, which is controlled by pre- and intraoperative techniques such as visualization of white matter tracts and mapping (both asleep and awake) of critical functions such as language and control of strength."

patients with evidence of a primary brain tumor and patients with a known glioma who will be undergoing surgery to remove the tumor may participate in this study.

a sample of tumor tissue removed in the course of a participant s normal clinical care will be used in this study for laboratory analysis of genes and chromosome abnormalities. a small blood sample will also be collected for genetic analysis. in addition, clinical information on patients condition and response to treatment will be collected every 6 months over several years. this information will include findings from physical and neurologic examinations, radiographic findings, and response to therapy, including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy."

these new anti-angiogenic therapies, however, have significant adverse effects are common and some other more serious but rare.

hypertension is the most common side effect observed in patients treated with anti-vegf. this is usually iatrogenic hypertension controlled by antihypertensive therapy and rarely compromises the pursuit of anti-angiogenic therapy. more rarely, it can have serious consequences malignant hypertension, severe hypertension refractory reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy associated with severe hypertension have also been reported.

the pathophysiology of hypertension may be due to the neutralization of major physiological effects of vegf in endothelial cell and therefore the vascular wall.

the study of the microcirculation is not only useful in the diagnosis of microvascular but also macrovascular disease in the evaluation of chronic arterial and venous severe it determines the prognosis. in these indications, capillaroscopy remains the gold standard for all work pathophysiological because visualization of phenomena measured avoids artifacts and difficulties of interpretation. it then appealed to additional technology to directly measure the capillary pressure, capillary flow velocity, and indirectly assess capillary permeability and function of lymphatic canaliculi. the simplest of these technological inputs: video microscopy and digital image analysis, have also improved the practice of routine clinical capillaroscopy in its main field of application, evaluation of microangiopathy connective. the examination can be performed more quickly and easily archived and quantified.

only two studies on 14 and 16 patients were able to see a decrease in capillary density correlated with the therapeutic activity of anti-angiogenic the tumor mass and metastasis.

thus, we propose to quantify in a number of relatively large patient patients the decrease in capillary density as well as the relationship between the decrease in the number of capillaries and anti-tumor response.

aggressive brain tumors like glioma have the ability to infiltrate the surrounding healthy brain tissue, disrupting normal neuronal activities and leading to impaired motor and cognitive functions, as well as causing epilepsy. this malignant brain tumor is considered one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. recent findings on direct neuron-tumor interactions indicate that abnormal brain activity in the regions surrounding brain tumors may contribute to develop epilepsy and accelerating tumor growth. tumors tend to 'fuel' themselves with neurotransmitters released during its 'daily' neuronal firing. hyperactive neurons in the peritumoral cortex can form excitatory electrochemical synapses with surrounding tumor cells, creating direct communication pathways within the peritumoral microenvironment, which aids in the progression and proliferation of tumor cells via direct and paracrine signalling pathways. however, the specific features of this abnormal brain activity in the peritumoral cortex have not been fully clarified and information on the pathological changes of neuronal activity in glioma patients is largely lacking. to advance more effective treatment strategies, it is crucial to better understand the complex interactions between the tumor and the brain.

this is especially important for the group of patients of which many perceive diminished quality of life because of epilepsy, cognitive functioning and language problems after tumor surgery. furthermore, a thorough understanding is lacking of what tumor resection does to the original hyperactive peritumoral cortex and if resecting this is beneficial for improving postoperative outcome both for epilepsy as well as regarding survival. therefore, identifying the hyperactive peritumoral cortex and directly addressing its impacts on the brain function and long-term surgical outcome could be a promising novel therapeutic strategy for treating glioma patients.

study aim

the measurement focuses on capturing neuronal activity at single-neuron resolution in the peritumoral cortex of glioma patients using cortical depth electrodes. it is well-established that gliomas can remodel the surrounding brain tissue, leading to abnormal neuronal hyperactivity, which contributes to tumor progression and epilepsy. however, the specific neuronal patterns and underlying mechanisms of these changes are not yet fully understood. this study will aim to collect detailed single-neuron recordings in this context, enabling us to map the precise neurophysiological disruptions caused by gliomas. on the long term, this research could lay the groundwork in identifying novel therapeutic approaches by providing critical in-sights into how gliomas alter brain function."

anti-angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy. vascular endothelial growth factor-a (vegf) is the primary driver of angiogenesis in tumors. bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vegf, is the prototypical anti-angiogenic drug and received accelerated approval of the united states food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. bevacizumab inproved the pfs-6% (36%), but had no effect on the overall survival (os) (9.2 months). moreover, the effects of bevacizumab are transient and most patients' tumors progress just after a median time of 3-5 months. recombinant human endostatin (rh-es) is an endogenous broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor that has been shown to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy when combining with conventional chemotherapy agents in non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma.

in our previous study, we retrospectively analyzed the effect and toxicity of rh-es when combined with temozolomide and irinotecan on adult recurrent disseminated glioblastoma. after combined treatment, pfs-6% was 23.3%; the median pfs and os were 3.2 and 6.9 months, respectively, which were promising compared with that in other studies. once patients get radiographic remission in a short time (4 months), they may get a long pfs.the combined regimen did not reduce the sensitivity of tumor to bevacizumab. after tumor progression from the combined chemotherapy, bevacizumab usage could help to prolong the survival time (5.1 months versus 2.4 months). moreover, the toxicities of the combination therapy in this study were manageable.

objective:

the purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-egfrviii cells) are a safe and effective treatment for advanced gliomas.

eligibility:

\- adults age 18-70 with malignant glioma expressing the egfrviii molecule.

design:

work up stage: patients will be seen as an outpatient at the national institutes of health (nih) clinical center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed

leukapheresis: if the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-egfrviii cells. {leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}

treatment: once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-egfrviii cells, and aldesleukin. they will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

follow up: patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans every month for the first year, and then every 1-2 months as long as their tumors are shrinking. follow up visits will take up to 2 days."

at the same time, in some patients, it can give rise to new symptoms like headaches, weakness, seizures,etc (symptomatic rn). the standard treatment of rn includes steroid medicines called dexamethasone, which is helpful in a proportion of patients.

this is a prospective phase 2 study. this study is being conducted to investigate the ability of the drug chlorophyllin in the treatment of radionecrosis.

chlorophyllin is a water-soluble compound obtained from the green plant pigment called chlorophyll. it has been shown to have anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. it is also used as an oral formulation and is an over-the-counter drug in various countries, and also as a food colouring agent.

this is the first time chlorophyllin will be used in the setting of brain radionecrosis. our primary aim of the study is to assess whether chl will improve the clinical-radiological response rates. this study will be conducted on a population of 118 patients for a duration of 3 months. the total study duration is 2 years.

children (at least 1 year old) and adults with primary malignant brain and spinal cord tumors may be eligible for this study. participants will have a medical history, physical and neurological examinations and routine blood tests. they may also undergo one or more of the following procedures:

* magnetic resonance imaging (mri) mri is a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of x-rays to show detailed changes in brain structure and chemistry. for the procedure, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. a contrast material called gadolinium may be used (injected into a vein) to enhance the images. the procedure takes about an hour, and the patient can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times.
* computed axial tomography (cat or ct) ct is a specialized form of x-ray imaging that produces 3-dimensional images of the brain in sections. the scanner is a ring device that surrounds the patient and contains a moveable x-ray source. the scan takes about 30 minutes and may be done with or without the use of a contrast dye.
* positron emission tomography (pet) pet is a diagnostic test that is based on differences in how cells take up and use glucose (sugar), one of the body s main fuels. the patient is given an injection of radioactive glucose. a special camera surrounding the patient detects the radiation emitted by the radioactive material and produces images that show how much glucose is being used by various tissues. fast-growing cells, such as tumors, take up and use more glucose than normal cells do, and therefore, the scan might indicate the overall activity or aggressiveness of the tumor. the procedure takes about an hour.

when all the tests are completed, the physician will discuss the results and potential treatment options with the patient. follow-up will vary according to the individual. some patients may end the study with just one visit to nih, while others may be followed at nih regularly, in conjunction with their local physicians. patients with aggressive tumors may be seen every 3 or 4 months, while those with less active tumors may be seen every 6 to 12 months. permission may be requested for telephone follow-up (with the patient or physician) of patients not seen regularly at nih.

integrative molecular-genetic approaches have provided important insights in the biology of glioblastoma. it has meanwhile become clear, that glioblastoma is not a single tumor entity but comprises different molecular subtypes, which are associated with a distinct genetic/epigenetic signature and prognosis. multimodal treatment approaches combining radio- and chemotherapy as well as the recent introduction of novel antiangiogenic agents have resulted in increasing survival times and improved quality-of-life of glioblastoma patients. yet, despite these intense treatment efforts the therapeutic efficacy in glioblastoma patients is limited, leading in virtually all cases to tumor recurrence and death of the patients.

as only a limited fraction of glioblastoma patients undergo second neurosurgery at tumor recurrence (\< 10%), post-therapeutic samples are rare and no systematic, large-scale studies exist, which address post-therapeutic morphological and molecular alterations in glioblastoma tumor tissue. yet, these data would help to improve the understanding of mechanisms involved in therapy-resistance and tumor progression, to develop new therapeutic approaches and could pave the way for personalized treatment strategies."

* growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) provides many tumors, including brain tumors, with needed nutrients and oxygen for cancer cells to survive. one possible treatment for different kinds of cancer involves treatment with drugs that slow or stop angiogenesis and prevent further tumor growth.
* vandetanib is an oral medication known to block angiogenesis and has shown significant antitumor activity in laboratory and animal studies. vandetanib appears to be well tolerated by patients at specific daily doses.
* carboplatin is a drug that interrupts division of cancer cells and has been shown to be a useful drug in treatment of tumors known as gliomas. it is a useful drug for treating brain tumors, but researchers are interested in gathering more information about how it works as a treatment for patients who have not responded to initial surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.

objective:

\- to determine the safety and effectiveness of vandetanib and carboplatin, given together or sequentially, against recurrent high-grade gliomas.

eligibility:

\- adults diagnosed with a malignant glioma who have received standard treatments that no longer appear to be effective.

design:

* patients will be assigned to one of two groups. group 1 patients (combination group) will receive oral vandetanib for 28 days and intravenous (iv) carboplatin (once at the beginning of the 28-day cycle). group 2 patients (sequential group) will receive iv carboplatin alone (once at the beginning of the 28-day cycle) and then oral vandetanib (300 mg daily) for 28 days if the tumor grows or the patient develops unacceptable carboplatin toxicity.

\- the blood-brain barrier helps to protect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) from harmful toxins, but also prevents potentially useful chemotherapy from reaching brain tumors. the barrier is formed by tight connections between blood vessel cells and molecules found on the surface of brain blood vessels such as permeability-glycoprotein (pgp). pgp may influence whether patients with brain tumors known as gliomas respond to chemotherapy and what side effects they may experience. the compound (11c)n-desmethyl-loperamide ((11c)dlop) reacts to pgp molecules, and therefore may be used with positron emission tomography (pet) imaging to study the blood brain barrier.

objectives:

\- to study the ability of pet imaging with (11c)dlop to evaluate the blood brain barrier in brain tumor patients.

patients who have been treated with bevacizumab for at least one month will be recruited to participate.

the subjects who are being treated with bevacizumab by dr. stephen wolin (a sub-investigator) will be screened by him for study eligibility. dr. wolin will approach eligible patients with all the information and background of the study and see if they have an interest in being consented.

if consented, there will be 2 blood draws for the research that is not part of their standard care in which 10 ml of blood is collected and prolactin, growth hormone, igf-i, tsh, thyroxine, acth, and cortisol will be measured. one 5ml blood draw will occur before the administration of bevacizumab and the second 5 ml blood draw will occur after the administration of the bevacizumab. the investigators will then review the laboratory results. the blood tests are of the hormones of the pituitary gland to test pituitary function and see if there are any abnormalities with the secretions of the gland. pituitary function abnormalities and hyperprolactinemia are diagnosed by looking at hormone levels in the blood and comparing them to the normal reference ranges.

optimal treatment consists of surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy but despite this survival is poor with only 10% of patients alive at 5 years.

standard imaging (mri and ct) may not detect the full extent of tumours before treatment and it can be difficult to assess how the tumour is responding to treatment.

the study aims to evaluate more advanced imaging techniques to see if they are better at mapping the whole tumour and assessing response to treatment. two different imaging techniques will be assessed: positron emission tomography - computed tomography (pet-ct) uses a mildly radioactive compound injected into the patient which is taken up into brain tumour cells and shows up as a bright spot on scans. brain tumours affect blood supply and how much fluid is in the brain tissue as well as how freely fluid can move around. advanced mr imaging known as multiparametric mri will be used to look at these additional features. this extra information may help improve planning of radiotherapy and assessing how tumours respond to treatment. twelve adult patients with glioblastoma undergoing radical treatment will be recruited over a 12 month period. each patient will have standard mr imaging before radiotherapy (after surgery) and 4-6 weeks following completion of radiotherapy. they will also have advanced mri and pet/ct before, during and after treatment.

the aim will be to study if this is feasible and could potentially improve radiotherapy planning and response assessment. imaging will be interpreted by both imaging and brain tumour treatment experts."

radiotherapy (rt) has been integral in the treatment of gbm since the 1970s when walker et al. showed that post-operative whole brain radiotherapy (wbrt) offered significant improvements in median survival time, and even more so when given with concomitant bcnu chemotherapy. ensuing dose escalation studies found the optimal dose to be 60 gy. patients could not tolerate escalation to higher doses than 60 gy with wbrt due to unacceptable toxicity. even with wbrt of 60 gy, a huge volume of healthy brain tissue was unnecessarily treated with high-dose radiation; recurrences with wbrt remained overwhelmingly local. hochberg and pruitt (1980) found that after wbrt only 3% of recurrences were outside 2 cm of the margins of the primary tumor. with the rise of the ct scan in the 1980s and the mri in the 1990s, along with subsequent improvements in three-dimensional conformal radiation, partial brain rt (pbrt) became practical since tumor margins could be visualized and irradiated more accurately. - subsequently, wbrt was shown to provide no survival benefit over pbrt at the same dosage; - thus, the latter took over as the standard of care."

this study aims to develop and test an intervention that helps healthcare professionals better support relatives in their caregiving role. the intervention uses a dialogue tool, which is designed to help nurses assess and follow up on the differing needs of relatives for involvement in the care of patients with abi and pmbt. the goal is to enhance the experience of both the patient and their caregivers throughout the illness process.

the study will take place across seven units in two regions of denmark, and it involves relatives of patients with abi or pmbt. the main questions the study aims to answer are:

* can an intervention that involves relatives improve their role in the care of patients with abi and pmbt?
* will this intervention help both patients and their relatives feel more supported and satisfied during the treatment process?

participants will receive support through an intervention that includes several key components:

* nurse training on how to use the dialogue tool to assess and address the varying needs of relatives for involvement.
* a list created by relatives, for relatives, to share experiences and advice with one another.
* video materials explaining the background and purpose of the intervention to help relatives understand how it can benefit them.
* guidelines for documenting the involvement of relatives in the patient's electronic health record.

by offering targeted support to relatives, this intervention aims to enhance their involvement in the treatment process, ensuring that both patients with abi or pmbt and their families are better supported throughout the course of the illness."

when interpreting follow-up magnetic resonance (mr) examinations, the radiologist is often confronted with images that are difficult to interpret with the conventional anatomical imaging techniques. the difference between tumour relapse and therapy-mediated changes is not always distinctive.

in this project, the investigators attempt to characterize the inflammatory response with parameters from advanced mri techniques like mr spectroscopy, mr perfusion imaging and mr-diffusion imaging. these techniques allow characterization of cellular properties like metabolism and tissue structure respectively. doing so, the investigators will monitor disease evolution in order to timely detect treatment failure, thereby allowing appropriate switch in patient management."

high grade gliomas represent the most common primary brain malignancy and prognosis remains poor. the most common subtype is glioblastoma which has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 5% . despite advances in mri techniques, prediction and diagnosis of treatment failure remains a challenge. the result is frequent imaging mixed with uncertainty regarding the presence of viable tumor versus post-treatment effects. furthermore, follow-up of these patients represents a high cost to the health system while symptom or disease control remains limited. a more accurate means identifying viable tumor is needed to guide management, reduce costs, and ultimately to improve patient survival and quality of life.

0-(2-18f-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine positron emission tomography (fet) is an amino acid agent derived from tyrosine that is able to cross the blood brain barrier. it has been studied primarily in diagnosis and detection of tumor recurrence in glioblastomas with emerging evidence for its use in brain metastases. compared to conventional mri, fet-pet has been shown to delineate geographically distinct tumor volume in newly diagnosed gbm suggesting the complementarity of the two modalities."

survaxm will be mixed with montanide isa 51 before it is given. montanide isa 51 is an ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response in people, which helps the vaccine work better.

this study has two phases: priming and maintenance. during the priming phase, patients will get one dose of survaxm combined with montanide isa 51 through a subcutaneous injection (a shot under the skin) at the start of the study and every 2 weeks for 6 weeks (for a total of 4 doses). at the same time that patients get the survaxm/montanide isa 51 injection, they will also get a second subcutaneous injection of a medicine called sargramostim. sargramostim is given close to the survaxm//montanide isa 51 injection and works to stimulate the immune system to help the survaxm/montanide isa 51 work more effectively.

if a patient completes the priming phase without severe side effects and his or her disease stays the same or improves, he or she can continue to the maintenance phase. during the maintenance phase, the patient will get a survaxm/montanide isa 51 dose along with a sargramostim dose about every 8 weeks for up to two years.

after a patient finishes the study treatment, the doctor and study team will continue to follow his/her condition and watch for side effects up to 3 years following the last dose of survaxm/montanide isa 51. patients will be seen in clinic every 3 months during the follow-up period."

in this context, innovative strategies are necessary to identify new therapeutic targets and implement new treatments to overcome resistance phenomena in the clinic.

objective: our goal will be to generate tumoroids and stem-like cell lines (pdx) from patient tumor samples.

methods: we will establish tumor tumoroids and stem cell lines from patient samples. these preclinical models will allow us to test a large number of drugs, quickly and efficiently thanks to models as close as possible to patient tumors and limiting the use of animal models (3r).

overall, this project should enable major advances in the treatment of glioblastoma and brain metastases and enable the rapid testing of new molecules in clinical trials thanks to the homology of our models with our patients' diseases."

healthy volunteers and patients who have received radiation therapy as part of their treatment for a brain tumor may be eligible for this study. all candidates must be at least 21 years old. patients must have a new area of abnormality that requires a biopsy to determine whether it is a tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis. candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination. in addition, patients have blood and urine tests.

all participants undergo mri and dt-mri. mri uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of x-rays to obtain images of body organs and tissues. the mri scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. during the mri, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises that occur during the scanning. scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting 40-60 minutes. subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 20 minutes at a time. dt-mri is a type of mri that measures how water moves in the brain tissue. this technique uses the same mri machine as conventional mri, but the diffusion images are obtained after the normal mri scan, and by a computer program that is installed into the machine. this completes the participation of healthy subjects.

this study focuses on the treatment of a category of brain tumors called gliomas. low-grade gliomas are tumors arising from the glial cells of the central nervous system and are characterized by slower, less aggressive growth than that of high-grade gliomas. some low-grade gliomas have a more aggressive biology and an increased likelihood of resistance or recurrence.

low-grade gliomas are often able to be treated by observation alone if they receive a total surgical resection. however, tumors which are only partially resected and continue to grow or cause symptoms, or those which recur following total resection require additional treatment, such as chemotherapy. due to their more aggressive nature, pilomyxoid astrocytomas, even when totally resected, will often be treated with chemotherapy. the current first-line treatment at our institution for these low-grade gliomas involves a three-drug chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide. however, based on our data from our own historical controls, over 50% of patients with pilomyxoid astrocytomas will continue to have disease progression while on this treatment. we believe that mebendazole in combination with vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide may provide an additional therapeutic benefit with increased progression-free and overall survival for low-grade glioma patients, particularly for those with pilomyxoid astrocytomas.

high grade gliomas are more aggressive tumors with poor prognoses. the standard therapy is radiation therapy. a variety of adjuvant chemotherapeutic combinations have been used, but with disappointing results. for high-grade gliomas this study will add mebendazole to the established combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan to determine this combinations safety and efficacy"

NCT06649591,Expert Consensus and Artificial Intelligence in Medical Decision Making in Patients with Malignant Brain Tumors,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,malignant brain tumors,BEHAVIORAL: Survey,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, United States","nearly 23,000 adults are diagnosed with primary central nervous system (cns) malignancy yearly. an additional 200,000 adults are diagnosed with brain metastasis. there are significant variations in cns tumor treatment. however, due to significant heterogeneity in patient baseline factors, identifying unwarranted variation is challenging. ghogawala et al have previously demonstrated that, among patients undergoing surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy and lumbar degenerative spinal disease, an expert panel consisting of surgeon experts can identify variations in proposed surgical procedure and demonstrated superior patient outcomes when the surgery performed matched the procedure recommended by expert consensus. expert panel surveys have not previously been used to identify variations in care among patients with cns malignancy.

the primary aim is to determine whether patient outcomes are superior when treatment aligns with recommendations made by a clinical expert neurosurgical panel. the study also seek to identify patient factors that predispose to variability in care. our long-term aim is to determine whether predictive artificial learning algorithms can achieve the same outcomes, or better, as clinical expert panels, but with greater efficiency and greater capacity to be available for more patients. the investigators hypothesize that:

* when a team of 10 medical experts has greater than 80% consensus regarding optimal treatment and when the doctor and patient select that specific treatment, the outcome is superior than when a patient and doctor select an alternative procedure.
* when a team of 10 medical experts has greater than 80% consensus regarding optimal treatment, the structured data used by the experts can be processed and trained by computing algorithms to predict the pattern recognized by the experts - i.e. - the computer can predict how an expert panel would vote.

procedures include the following:

1. chart review portion of study: patients will be identified from case logs of the principal investigators from july 2017 through july 2023. data will be collected retrospectively and will include age, non-identifier demographics, diagnosis details, operative/treatment characteristics, post-treatment characteristics, and follow-up characteristics. images reviewed will include pre and post-treatment mris obtained as part of routine care. data will be abstracted from the medical record (epic/soarian and pacs) and recorded in an excel database.
2. survey portion of study: de-identified structured radiographic data and a brief clinical vignette without patient identifiers will be uploaded to acesis healthcare process optimization platform (http://www.acesis.com/our-platform). a survey will be generated by acesis and emailed to the subject experts/participants. this portion is prospective.
3. cohort definitions:

   1. patients will be assigned to either ""expert-treatment consensus"" or ""no expert-treatment consensus"" arms based on whether greater than 80% consensus is achieved
   2. patients will be assigned to either ""expert consensus-aligned"" or ""expert consensus - unaligned"" arms based on whether expert survey results match actual treatment given.
4. data will then be analyzed using appropriate packages with sas statistical analysis software. survival analysis will be performed to determine whether consensus predicts improved progression free survival (pfs).
5. the structured and de-identified radiographic images used by the experts in surveys will be used for training and development of an ai algorithm. the aim of this portion of the study is to determine whether standardized and structured imaging can be used to train an algorithm to predict whether expert consensus is achieved and the recommended treatment."

we are asking people to be in this research study who have been diagnosed with a high grade glioma, their tumor has been screened for the rb1 protein, and they have recently finished radiation therapy. if a patient has dipg or a bi-thalamic high grade glioma, they do not need to have the tumor tissue screened for the rb1 protein, but do need to have finished radiation therapy.

tumor cells grow and divide quickly. in normal cells, there are proteins that control how fast cells grow but in cancer cells these proteins no longer work correctly making tumor cells grow quickly. both study drugs work in different ways to slow down the growth of tumor cells. the researchers think that if the study drugs are given together soon after radiation therapy, it may help improve the effect of the radiation in stopping or slowing down tumor growth.

the study drugs, ribociclib and everolimus, have been approved by the united states food and drug administration (fda). ribociclib is approved to treat adults with breast cancer and everolimus is approved for use in adults and children who have other types of cancers. the combination of ribociclib and everolimus has not been tested in children or in people with brain tumors and is considered investigational.

the goals of this study are:

* find the safest dose of ribociclib and everolimus that can be given together after radiation.
* learn the side effects (both good and bad) the study drugs have on the body and tumor.
* measure the levels of study drug in the blood over time.

NCT02149459,Treatment of Recurrent Brain Tumors: Metabolic Manipulation Combined With Radiotherapy,UNKNOWN,brain neoplasms,RADIATION: Partial brain re-irradiation.|DRUG: Metformin|BEHAVIORAL: low carbohydrate diet,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, 52621, Israel","recurrent brain tumours are extremely aggressive and despite optimal treatment, median survival is less than two years. one of the standard treatment options in this situation is radiation therapy. currently there is intense scientific interest concerning the abnormal energy metabolism in cancer cells. all cells require energy in order to function, obtaining 'fuel' molecules such as glucose and fatty acids from the blood stream. brain tumours exhibit ""metabolic reprogramming"", meaning that their energy requirements and utilization of fuel molecules are quite different from normal cells. brain tumour cells are exquisitely dependant on glucose as a source of energy. animal studies have shown that when these tumours are deprived of glucose they are very sensitive to radiation therapy.

in this clinical trial the investigators combine radiation therapy with a low-carbohydrate diet, in patients with recurrent brain tumours. in addition, subjects will receive medication with metformin, a drug usually used to treat diabetes. metformin inhibits glucose metabolism within cancer cells, and additionally has reported intrinsic anti-cancer activity. subjects will undergo advanced imaging and hormonal studies before, during and after the trial in order to obtain maximal translational-scientific impact.

the hypothesis:

the metabolic changes induced by the combination of a moderately-low carbohydrate diet combined with supplementary mct and metformin therapy will selectively starve tumor cells. while normal brain cells are capable of deriving energy from ketone bodies during glucose restriction, tumor cells remain largely glucose-dependent for energy due to oncogene induced down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. while the tumor cells are in this 'vulnerable' state they will be less able to repair the damage induced by ionizing radiation.

short-term implementation of the metabolic intervention (i.e. combined diet and metformin therapy) prior to, during, and after hypofractionated (2 week) radiation therapy is expected to increase tolerability, increase compliance and avoid the chronic metabolic complications associated with extreme carbohydrate restriction diets."

5. gliomatosis cerebri (gc) for 1.-3. diagnosis has to be confirmed by neuropathological survey, for 4. and 5. diagnosis has to be confirmed by neuroradiological survey.

in addition to standard treatment (radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy) the effect of valproic acid which is traditionally used for treatment of seizure disorder, will be investigated. the aim of the trial will be to investigate whether this drug may increase the effects of radio- and chemotherapy, resulting in a better survival of the treated patients. scientific studies provided evidence for anti-tumoral effects of valproic acid: the drug seems to be a so-called histondeacetylase inhibitor (hdac inhibitor), controlling important genetic processes of tumor growth.

studies in cell culture, animals and first clinical trials in adults as well provided evidence for efficacy of valproic acid in the treatment of glioblastoma. due to this we hope children and adolescents suffering from gbm, dmg, aa, dipg und gc will benefit from the treatment, too.

the aim of the hit-hgg-2013 trial will be to compare the effects of valproic acid with data of the hit-hgg-2007 trial (children and adolescents with same diseases, only treated with simultaneous temozolomide radiochemotherapy).

in the present study, it was originally planned to investigate the therapeutic efficiency and safety of valproic acid and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, both in addition to temozolomide therapy. since distribution of resochin junior (chloroquine phosphate) was terminated, recruitment of new patients was stopped on august 8, 2019. for continuation of the trial, the chloroquine arm was closed but the patients already recruited in this arm will be followed up."

there is no treatment provided on this study. patients who have csf samples taken as part of regular care will be asked to provide extra samples for this study. the study doctor will collect a minimum of one extra tube of csf (about 1 teaspoon or 5 ml) for this study. if the patients doctor thinks it is safe, up to 2 tubes of csf (about 4 teaspoons or up to 20 ml) may be collected. csf will be collected through the indwelling catheter device or through a needle inserted into the lower part of the patient's spine (known as a spinal tap or lumbar puncture).

a required blood sample (about ½ a teaspoon or 2 3 ml) will be collected once at the start of the study. this sample will be used to help determine changes found in the csf. blood will be collected from the patient's central line or arm as a part of regular care.

an optional tumor tissue if obtained within 8 weeks of csf collection will be collected if available. similarities between changes in the dna of the tissue that has caused the tumor to form and grow with the cfdna from csf will be compared. this will help understand if csf can be used instead of tumor tissue for diagnosis. up to 300 people will take part in this study.

this study will use genetic tests that may identify changes in the genes in the csf. the report of the somatic mutations (the mutations that are found in the tumor only) will become part of the medical record. the results of the cfdna sequencing will be shared with the patient. the study doctor will discuss what the results mean for the patient and patient's diagnosis and treatment. looking for inheritable mutations in normal cells (blood) is not the purpose of this study. genetic tests of normal blood can reveal information about the patient and also about the their relatives. the doctor will discuss what the tests results may mean for the patient and the their family. patient may be monitored on this study for up to 5 years."

in a healthy person, progastrin is not detectable in the peripheral blood. however, progastrin is abnormally released in the blood of patients with different cancers (colorectal, gastric, ovarian, breast, cervix uterus, melanoma…) the gene gast coding for progastrin is a direct target gene of the wnt/ß-catenin oncogenic pathway. the activation of this oncogenic pathway is an early event in cancer development.

chronic activation of the wnt/ß-catenin oncogenic pathway occurs in almost all human solid tumors and is a central mechanism in cancer biology that induces cellular proliferation, blocking of differentiation leading to primary tumor growth and metastasis formation.

progastrin measured in the peripheral blood of patients on treatments, could be a new powerful marker for diagnosis and prognosis at different stages."

NCT01682746,Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for Recurrent Pediatric Brain Tumors,COMPLETED,"brain tumor, recurrent",DRUG: Photofrin (porfimer sodium) & photodynamic therapy.,"CHILD, ADULT","Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, 53226, United States","the goal of this proposal is to evaluate a new photodynamic therapy (pdt) modification which could revolutionize the treatment of brain tumors in children and adults. there are currently few cases published involving the use of pdt in infratentorial (in the posterior fossa) brain tumors in general and specifically those occurring in children. the investigators propose to test a technique, for the first time in the u.s., that demonstrated in australian adult glioblastoma patients dramatic long-term, survival rates of 57% (anaplastic astrocytoma) and 37% (glioblastoma multiforme). these results are unprecedented in any other treatment protocol.

photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a paradigm shift in the treatment of tumors from the traditional resection and systemic chemotherapy methods. the principle behind photodynamic therapy is light-mediated activation of a photosensitizer that is selectively accumulated in the target tissue, causing tumor cell destruction through singlet oxygen production. therefore, the photosensitizer is considered to be the first critical element in pdt procedures, and the activation procedure is the second step. the methodology used in this proposal utilizes more intensive laser light and larger photofrin photosensitizer doses than prior pdt protocols in the u.s. for brain tumor patients. the pdt will consist of photoillumination at 630 nm beginning at the center of the tumor resection cavity, and delivering a total energy of 240 j cm-2. the investigators feel that the light should penetrate far enough into the tissue to reach migrating tumor cells, and destroy these cells without harming the healthy cells in which they are dispersed.

the investigators will be testing the hypothesis that pediatric subjects with progressive/recurrent malignant brain tumors undergoing pdt with increased doses of photofrin® and light energy than were used in our previous clinical study will show better progression free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) outcomes. pdt will also be effective against infratentorial tumors. the specific aims include determining the maximum tolerable dose (mtd) of photofrin in children and looking for preliminary effectiveness trends."
